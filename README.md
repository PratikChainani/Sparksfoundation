# The Sparks foundation Task #1: Basic Banking System Webiste
I have created a Basic Banking System Website as a Web development intern of #GRIPFEB21 (Graduate Rotational Internship Program) at The Sparks Foundation.
The task was to create a simple dynamic website with following specifications : View customers, Transfer money among them and record the Transaction history of the customers.
Flow of the Website: Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to >View all Customers

I have used PHP for the backend and created different .php files based on the sequential flow of the Website as mentioned above.
